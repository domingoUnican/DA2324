# Challenge: Can you implement a scheme interpreter in Python that's
# capable of executing the following procedure?

# A procedure definition for:
#
#   (define fact
#      (lambda (n) (if (= n 1)
#                   1
#                   (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
#
# It's represented in Python using the following tuple:

fact = ('define', 'fact', 
        ('lambda', ('n',), ('if', ('=', 'n', 1),
                            1,
                            ('*', 'n', ('fact', ('-', 'n', 1))))))



# You will define the following procedure for evaluating an expression
def seval(sexp):
    ...

# In writing seval, you are ONLY allowed to use the rules of Scheme
# evaluation that you currently know about.  So far, this includes the
# substitution model and the notion of special forms.
    
# Some basic tests
assert seval(42) == 42
assert seval(('+', 2, 3)) == 5
seval(('define', 'n', 5))
assert seval('n') == 5

# Now the ultimate test--can you run your procedure?
seval(fact)
assert seval(('fact', 'n')) == 120
